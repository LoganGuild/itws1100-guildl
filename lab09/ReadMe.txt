I thought that lab09 was definitely the hardest lab out of all of them just for the amount of work that needed to be done, as well as the difficulty of databases in general. I had a tough time learning how to use databases and how to use phpMyAdmin in general, so that took awhile. Another thing that I thought was hard to learn was coding in php and making those tables to show up. I had a difficult time doing that as well which made the lab more challenging. I think in the future more descriptive instructions would be helpful as I felt like the instructions currently in the readme didn't give me too many directions to go and I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out what some of the instructions meant. However, I felt like this lab did help me learn php and sql much better than I knew it before the lab.
