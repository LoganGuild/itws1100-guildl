I thought this lab was very hard and confusing. I felt that there were a lot of more vague instructions than previous labs and I thought specifically, the RSS formatting with CSS was harder than normal, and frequently messed me up. Overall however, I felt like once I persevered through the lab I feel like it taught me a lot about RSS feeds and I felt that this lab was interesting in that aspect.
