The comment table on my website has 4 sections. First, it contains a primary key, commentid, which is an auto increment primary key that determines the number of comments produced. Second there is a name field that requires a valid name inputted so that we are aware of who submitted the comment. Next, It asks for an email. This is just intended so that we have a form of communication if there is a large issue and I want to notify the person who submitted the comment. This is also to provide another form of verification for the comments. Next, the comment is inputted which is stored by the database associated with the comment. After the comment, there is an automatic timestamp value which the user when they submit the comment has the timestamp taken when they submit and gives the time that they submitted the comment on the page. Finally, the status field is used to determine whether the comments are validated and given to the database to store.

To test the comment system, you should be able to go to the homepage, which has a direct link to the page to submit a comment. You can then enter the values into the required fields and submit the comment and check if it submitted by looking at the top of the page, which should then have your comment.

I used AI mostly on sections where I had difficulty finding a solution to specific problems. For example, I was having an error with loading commentsubs.php on my website, so I prompted AI to ask why this error was occurring and what I could do to possibly resolve the error. Another section where I used AI Assistance was with the code that checks for a database error, as I was having issues with submitting the comment forms as it was giving an error but I wanted to format that error so that people knew what was incorrect. A third section where I used AI was to help with clearing the name and email database areas of whitespace and striping html and php tags from those inputs. This allows for the text to show up better formatted and looks better. Finally, I used AI assistance to help with formatting the timestamp code and how the comments look by transforming newline to breaks.
