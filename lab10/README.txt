I thought that this lab was relatively easy but also interesting. It was useful to learn how to use various commands such as the php header function and mv or cp. I don't think there could be much to improve this lab, but in the future, I would recommend to change formatting of the bullet points to make it easier to understand which are instructions of previous steps or just an instruction by itself.
