<p><br>In this lab, I created a resume using HTML and CSS. The purpose of the assignment was to practice combining structure and design to make a very baseline but professional looking resume. HTML was used to organize my resume contents, while CSS was used to style the page and make it look professional.
I started by building the basic structure that I wanted for the website, followed by adding all the content that I felt was important to add to my resume. I used headings, lists, and paragraphs to organize the information clearly. This lab taught be the basics of HTML and CSS and showed me what is possible when I combine both.
