I thought that this lab was really interesting as it taught me significantly more knowledge about CSS and HTML and I felt that giving us full reign of our websites was a great idea to teach us more about both of those. I chose the red and black design after taking inspiration from my favorite color pairing and I feel like both of those colors complement each other really well. for my lab folder, I decided to have the website with zip files instead of a landing page for each lab since I felt that downloading the entire file was more useful that just have the links on the website. In the about me section, I chose to  choose a unique font to drag in readers and get them to learn more about me.
